# Start -

* my mother and I talked last night - tell me more about your family
* i said no! - why so negative?
* the weather is nice - you don't say/hmmm./ do you really think so?
* do you know my brother? - why so negative? (i think that the bot sees the string "no" anywhere and responds as if the user simply said "no". i confirmed this by testing it further.)

# Exercises -

## Three New Keywords (and responses)-

* friend (what are your friends like?)
